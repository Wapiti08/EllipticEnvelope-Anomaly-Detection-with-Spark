# EllipticEnvelope-Anomaly-Detection-with-Spark

The achievement of EllipticEnvelope with the ability to combine time series feature in anomaly detection

# Desired Features
- Big dataset processing with Spark
- High Speed of Detection with Scala as the choice for feature-engineering
- Waiting to confirm the dataset to detect
- Detect the features with time (by spliting the detection with a specific parameter)

# On going ...
